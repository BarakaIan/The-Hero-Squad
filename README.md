## Author
#  by Ian Baraka

## Description
# Create an app that allows you to recruit a well-balanced team of superheroes (or any other character-type of your choosing).

.Create a Hero object: At the very least, they should have a name, age, special power and weakness. Special powers and weaknesses could be freely assignable or you may offer users a pre-determined set to choose from.

.Create a Squad object: They should have a max size, name, and a cause they're are dedicated to fighting (sexism, computer illiteracy, not covering your mouth when you sneeze, hogging bus seats with your backpack, passive-aggressive post-it notes, etc).

.Allow users to assign Heros to a Squad. Each hero can only participate in one Squad at a time.
